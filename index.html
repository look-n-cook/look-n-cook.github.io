      <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Help improve the nutritional content and variety of foods eaten by students.</li>
        <li>Help UH students limit the use of vending machines or fast food products by providing tasty, realistic alternatives.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Features Provided</h2>
      <p>This site provides UH students the ability to learn and share recipes. Trying to find the ingredients for these recipes is sometimes a hassle. So we have included a way for vendors around UH to provide information about the different ingredients that are used in the recipes. If the vendor sells the specific ingredient, they can include the price and the size of that ingredient.</p>

      <h3>Landing Page</h2>
        <p>Only a visitor of the app who is not logged into an account will see this page. From here, he or she can only log in or sign up. This page describes the main features of the Look ‘n’ Cook.</p>
        <img medium centered src="doc/PageLanding.PNG">
      
      <h3>User Home Page</h2>
        <p>The User Home page replaces the Landing page after the user signs in. It displays the 6 most recent recipes. The recipe cards on this page only give the user the option to go to the full recipe page.</p>
        <img medium centered src="doc/PageUserHome.png">
      
      <h3>User Profile Page</h2>
        <p>Each user has a unique profile page. Users can get there by clicking on their username and selecting the “Profile” tab. It displays all the recipes that he or she has created, and the recipe cards have the option to view, edit, or delete a recipe. </p>
        <img medium centered src="doc/PageProfile.png">
      
      <h3>Add Recipe Page</h2>
        <p>Users can add new recipes for other users to view. They can reach this page via the “Add Recipe” tab in the navigation menu. Here, they can specify the recipe name and dietary restrictions; add a brief description and image; and list the required ingredients and steps. </p>
        <img medium centered src="doc/PageAddRecipe.png">
      
      <h3>Edit Recipe Page</h2>
        <p>The edit tab on the recipe cards in the User Profile page leads to this page that has an identical lay out to the Add Recipe page. The difference is that the field are already filled with the information about the recipe that the user is trying to edit. The user can change the fields just like on Add Recipe page, and the recipe will be updated after clicking the “Submit” button.</p>
        <img medium centered src="doc/PageEdit.PNG">
      
      <h3>Recipes Admin Page</h2>
        <p>The Recipes Admin page is viewable only by an admin user, and lists all of the recipes saved in the system. The list displays the recipe names, the respective creators, and the dates that all the recipes were created on without the frills that a user would usually see.</p>
        <img medium centered src="doc/PageRecipesAdmin.png">
      
      <h3>Users Admin Page</h2>
        <p>The Users Admin page acts similarly to the Recipes Admin page. Instead of recipes, this page lists all of the users in the app. The list contains all the users and the number of recipes that a user has created.</p>

      <p>Over the course of developing Look 'n' Cook, we created Milestones that had issues that needed to be worked on before a certain due date. To manage these issues, we used GitHub projects to assign the issuses to different memebers. The following sections highlight the issues that were accomplished in each Milestone.</p>      
      <h2 id="M1">Milestone 1: Mockup Developement</h2> 
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>Start Date</th>
          <th>End Date</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>April 3, 2018</td>
          <td>April 12, 2018</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>For this Milestone, we wanted to create mockup designs of the possible pages that we plan to implement. Below are some of the designs that we came up with.</p>
      <h3>Mockup Pages</h3>
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page01.jpg">
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page02.jpg">
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page03.jpg">
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page04.jpg">
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page05.jpg">
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page06.jpg">
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page07.jpg">
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page08.jpg">
      <img width="200px" src="doc/page09.jpg">
      <p>We were able to complete the design for our landing page and decide on a color scheme to use. We were also able to deploy our application.</p>
      <img medium centered src="doc/Landing.PNG">
      <p>As we were implementing the user home page and profile pages, we soon realized that we would need to create a schema for our recipes. With a recipe schema, we would be able to create recipe cards to display on the user home and profile page. So we started to work on the schema for our recipes in Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 as well.</p>
      <p>Milestone 1 was implemented as <a href="https://github.com/look-n-cook/Look-n-Cook/projects/1">Look 'n' Cook GitHub Milestone M1</a>:</p>
      <img medium centered src="doc/M1Board.PNG">
      
      <!-- --------------- -->
      <!-- MILESTONE    #2 -->
      <!-- --------------- -->
      
      <h2 id="M2">Milestone 2: Recipe Schema</h2> 
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>Start Date</th>
          <th>End Date</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>April 12, 2018</td>
          <td>April 24, 2018</td>
        </tr>
      </table>      
      <p>For Milestone 2, we were able to impliement the recipe schemas, add/edit recipe pages, and admin pages. The biggest task of this milestone was to design and impliment the recipe schema. At first, we wanted to have two different schemas, one for recipes, and one for ingredients. Each ingredient would hold the ID to the recipe it belongs to. With this concept in mind, we started to impliment the schema. However, we ran into problems and had trouble implimenting it. So we created an array of ingredients in each recipe schema. Once a recipe schema was created, we were able to create an "add recipe" page and give the user the ability to view the details of each recipe. The "add recipe" page is a form that enables you to add ingredients and steps by clicking the "+" button.</p>     
      <img medium centered src="doc/AddRecipe.PNG">      
      <p>We were also able to make some cosmetic changes and start implimenting some of the Admin features.</p>     
      <p>Milestone 2 was implemented as <a href="https://github.com/look-n-cook/Look-n-Cook/projects/2">Look 'n' Cook GitHub Milestone M2</a>:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
          <th>Start Date</th>
          <th>End Date</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>April 25, 2018</td>
          <td>May 4, 2018</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Milestone 3 consisted of implimenting vendor and admin accounts and adding new features to the student accounts based on the feedback we got after implementing M2. Each vendor is able to add and view all the ingredients that they have inputted into the system. In addition vendors also have the ability to view the recipes that students have inputted. Admins have the ability to delte and view all the recipes, ingredients, users, and vendors.</p> 
      <p>One of the suggestions that we got was to include a comment/review section for each recipe. To implement this, we added a rating/review box at the bottom of every recipe page. The page will also show ratings/reviews from other users. We also added a table of possible vendors in each recipe page. This way people who view the recipe now can see where to buy certain ingredients and possible costs.</p> 
      <img medium centered src="doc/vendorReview.PNG">
        <p>One of the main features that we finished in this milestone was the ability for all users to search for certain recipes based on keywords, date, ingredients, and dietary restrictions.</p>

      <h1 id="community">Community Feedback</h1>
      <h2>Community Findings After Implimentations in M2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Include a comment/review section for each recipe. This way users who tried out the recipe could give some feedback for other users.</li>
        <li>Include a level of difficulty scale. Some UH students do not know how to cook, so knowing that there are easy recipes would be helpful.</li>
        <li>Add a rating system which calculates the average rating for the recipe based on other user's ratings.</li>
        <li>Could not find the profile page easily.</li>
        <li>Needs to include brief instructions on how to use the website when a user first logs in.</li>

# About Look 'n' Cook

## Goals of the Project

<ul>
  <li>Help improve the nutritional content and variety of foods eaten by students.</li>
  <li>Help UH students limit the use of vending machines or fast food products by providing tasty, realistic alternatives.</li>
</ul>

## Features Provided

This site provides UH students the ability to learn and share recipes. Trying to find the ingredients for these recipes is sometimes a hassle. So we have included a way for vendors around UH to provide information about the different ingredients that are used in the recipes. If the vendor sells the specific ingredient, they can include the price and the size of that ingredient.

# Development History
Over the course of developing Look 'n' Cook, we created Milestones that had issues that needed to be worked on before a certain due date. To manage these issues, we used GitHub projects to assign the issuses to different memebers. The following sections highlight the issues that were accomplished in each Milestone.
